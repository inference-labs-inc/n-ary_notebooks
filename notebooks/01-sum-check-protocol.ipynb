    "**Remark.** (i) The total degree of a univariate polynomial ($v = 1$) is just its degree. We may use the terms _degree_ and _total degree_ interchangeably. (ii) The zero polynomial is denoted by $0$. Context will always make clear whether $0$ denotes the zero polynomial or the zero element of $\\mathbb{F}$. The nonzero constant polynomials are precisely those of total degree $0$. We leave the degree of the zero polynomial undefined. Some authors, however, define it as $-\\infty$ for convenience, which simplifies statements like $\\mathrm{deg}(g_1 + g_2) \\le \\max\\{\\mathrm{deg}(g_1),\\mathrm{deg}(g_2)\\}$ and $\\mathrm{deg}(g_1g_2) = \\mathrm{deg}(g_1) + \\mathrm{deg}(g_2)$, without needing to exclude the zero polynomial as a special case. (iii) On the other hand, if we consider $g$ as a $v$-variate polynomial in $\\mathbb{F}[X_0,\\ldots,X_{v-1}]$, then $\\mathrm{deg}_{j}(X_j)$ is defined and nonnegative for every $j$, $0 \\le j \\le v - 1$. Some authors might say, for instance, that the degree of $X_2$ in $X_0X_1 + X_1^2$, is undefined. In our case, if we understand the polynomial as belonging to $\\mathbb{F}[X_0,X_1,X_2]$, then we note that we can multiply each term by $X_2^0$ without affecting the polynomial, whence the degree of $X_2$ in this polynomial is $0$. This convention ensures that $\\mathrm{deg}_j(g)$ is defined for all $j$, which will be important when tracking degree bounds variable-by-variable in the sum-check protocol.\n",

For a more explicit example: if $g(X_0,X_1,X_2) = X_0X_1X_2 + X_0X_1^2 + X_2$ then $g(X_0,1,1) = 2X_0 + 1$.\n",

Polynomials are really just sequences of coefficients that we add and multiply in a certain way. Indeterminates $X_j$ serve as placeholders&mdash;not variables&mdash;to encode formal algebraic operations independently of evaluation. If this remark seems opaque, consider that a univariate polynomial can be represented as a sequence of coefficients $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots)$, where only finitely many $a_i$ are nonzero. Given two polynomials $g = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots)$ and $h = (b_0, b_1, b_2, \\dots)$, their product $g \\cdot h$ is another sequence of coefficients $(c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots)$ defined by $c_k = \\sum_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}$."
